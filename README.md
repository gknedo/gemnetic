# Gemnetic

A simple genetic algorithm implementation.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gemnetic'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gemnetic

## Usage
Create a specimen class implementing the evaluate, randomize, crossover and mutate methods.
```
class MySpecimen < Gemnetic::Specimen

  def evaluate
    # returns a specimen evaluation, big is better.
  end

  def mutate
    # mutate the @gens variable and returns self
  end

  def randomize
    # returns random gens
  end

  def crossover specimen
    # crossover @gens with the specimen.gens and return self
  end
end
```

Initialize a world with:
```
world = Gemnetic::World.new(MySpecimenClass)
```

Run some steps and get the best
```
50.times do
    world.next_generation
end
world.best_specimen
```

DONE!
